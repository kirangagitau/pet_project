This is a collaborative project with the two of us aiming at learning, understanding and mastering
python programming language. It is common for developers to collaborate on on a project every now
and then. A period through which they learn from one another as well as advance their skills by
partaking on advanced tasks that are more challanging. I means isn't doing challanging tasks the
best way to advance our knowledge and skill set.
