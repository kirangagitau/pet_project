There are some collaborative projects with the two of us aiming at learning, understanding and mastering
python programming language. It is common for developers to collaborate on a project every now
and then. A period through which they learn from one another as well as advance their skills by
partaking on advanced tasks that are more challanging. I means isn't doing challanging tasks the
best way to advance our knowledge and skill set.
Best wishes to all of us as we partake the journey.
Happy coding.

!! good reading to us  all !!
